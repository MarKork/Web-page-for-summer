			<h2>What is summer</h2>
			<p>Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling after spring and before autumn. 
			At or around the summer solstice, the earliest sunrise and latest sunset occurs, the days are longest and the nights are shortest, 
			with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, 
			tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
			<br><br>
			Summer is traditionally associated with hot or warm weather. In the Mediterranean regions, it is also associated with dry weather, 
			while in other places (particularly in Eastern Asia because of the monsoon) it is associated with rainy weather. The wet season is the main 
			period of vegetation growth within the savanna climate regime. Where the wet season is associated with a seasonal shift in the prevailing winds, 
			it is known as a monsoon.
			<br><br>
			In the northern Atlantic Ocean, a distinct tropical cyclone season occurs from 1 June to 30 November. The statistical peak of the Atlantic 
			hurricane season is 10 September. The Northeast Pacific Ocean has a broader period of activity, but in a similar time frame to the Atlantic.
			The Northwest Pacific sees tropical cyclones year-round, with a minimum in February and March and a peak in early September. 
			In the North Indian basin, storms are most common from April to December, with peaks in May and November. In the Southern Hemisphere, 
			the tropical cyclone season runs from 1 November until the end of April with peaks in mid-February to early March.
			Thunderstorm season in the United States and Canada runs in the spring through summer but sometimes can run as late as October or even 
			November in the fall. These storms can produce hail, strong winds and tornadoes, usually during the afternoon and evening.</p>
